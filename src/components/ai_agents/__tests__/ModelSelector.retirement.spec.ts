/**
 * The one rule the pinned list cannot enforce on its own: an id whose end of service the
 * provider has already dated must be gone by that date. The axes that list live are
 * corrected the moment a key is chosen; vertex and perplexity never are, so this table is
 * the only thing that ever notices. Deliberately offline, so a guard whose whole job is
 * watching a date runs on every PR — the network specs are out of CI.
 *
 * Serving an id until its date is the posture, not an oversight: pulling it early costs
 * the user a model that still answers. CRM-462 wrote that down for the perplexity axis.
